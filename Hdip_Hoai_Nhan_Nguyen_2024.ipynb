    "Assume you are given the opportunity to work as a Machine Learning expert for a global bike rental firm that has operations in New York, London, Berlin, Chicago, San Francisco, Dublin, and other locations. The company offers three different bike kinds for rent: Standard, Mountain, and Electric. With 900 rows and a variety of features/ attributes/ columns, including City, Weather, Rider Age, Bike Model, Ride Length, Distance Covered, Rider Satisfaction, and Bike Rental Cost, the dataset is available on Moodle. <br>\n",

    "The company is interested to leverage the provided dataset to improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and pricing strategies. Your task is to understand and analyze the patterns in the customer behavior and bike rental usage across different cities, weather conditions, bike models, and age groups. Your analysis will guide the company to plan for the future and make ML based data-driven decisions on bike fleet management, pricing adjustments, and customer satisfaction improvements.\n",

    "1. Provide a conceptual understanding and logical justification based on the reasoning for the specific choice of machine learning approach (supervised/ Unsupervised) for the provided data set. You can discuss the pros and cons of both approaches based on your understanding. Make a set of independent and dependent variables based on your objectives for ML tasks. (0-20 marks) <br><br>\n",
    "2. Machine Learning models can be used for Prediction, Classification, and Clustering. You can choose suitable features for the machine learning models based on feature selection methods, such as random forest or any other method. The selection of hyperparameters for the ML models should be performed by using hyperparameter tuning, such as GridSearchCV. Obtain the best accuracy using optimal values of the hyperparameters. (0-30 marks) <br><br>\n",
    "3. You should train and test the Machine learning models in the case of supervised learning for different splits (at least 2 splits) and use appropriate metrics for unsupervised learning. Use k-fold (10 or 20 or 30) cross-validation to provide authenticity of the modelling outcomes. (0-30 marks)<br><br>\n",
